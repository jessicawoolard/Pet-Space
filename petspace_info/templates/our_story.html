            <p>I have an inside/outside cat named Sponge that frequently prowls the neighborhood. I wanted a way for
                someone finding him to know that he was not lost, just exploring.</p>
            <p>I have created this application that will let a pet owner create a web page for their pet with name,
                information, pictures and general home location. The pet’s collar could be fitted with a QR code tag,
                that when scanned would immediately load the pet’s web page. On the web page there is an <em>email my
                    owner</em> button so the person who found your pet could contact the owner.</p>
