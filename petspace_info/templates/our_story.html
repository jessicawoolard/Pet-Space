                <p>I have an inside/outside cat named Sponge that frequently prowls outside. I wanted a way for someone finding him to know that he was not lost, just exploring. I have created an application that will let a pet owner create a webpage for their pet with name, information, pictures and general home location. The pet’s collar could be fitted with a QR code tag, that when scanned would immediately load the pet’s webpage. On the webpage will be an 'email my owner' button so the person who found your pet could contact you.</p>
